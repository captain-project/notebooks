    "The following examples show how to setup a CAPTAIN analysis to optimize the placement of protection units (PUs).\n",
    "The empirical data analyzed here is from the paper by [Carrasco et al. 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-020-01947-1) and includes the predicted distribution for ~1500 species of endemic trees in Madagascar across 22,000 potential PUs and a quantification of the disturbance or threat to species across PUs. The files contain comma-separated values (CSV) and were formatted to be compatible with the program [Marxan](https://marxansolutions.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "In CAPTAIN we use these files to initialize an environment, over which we can then apply a pre-trained model to predict areas of priority for conservation.\n",
    "This is done using the `build_empirical_env()` function and passing 4 arguments:\n",
    "1. the working directory where all files are stored\n",
    "2. a CSV table containing species distribution data: this has three columns: a species identifier, a PU identifier, and the abundance of the species in the PU. For each PU there is one entry for each of the species found (or predicted through e.g. niche modeling) in it. In the example here we have only species presence/absence, so the abundance column will only have values of 0 and 1.\n",
    "3. a CSV table with the cost of protection listed for each PU. This can be a relative cost (i.e. indicating the relative difference in cost among PUs) and by default is assumed to be proportional to the anthropogenic disturbance on the PU.\n",
    "4. a CSV file with the coordinates of the mid-point of each PU. this is currently only used for plotting."

This protection target can be specified as a single value (e.g. `protection_target=0.1` indicates that 10% of the range should be protected for each species) or as a vector of values (of length equal to the number of species in the system) to apply a species-specific conservation target.\n",

In particular, each analysis assigns random sensitivities to the species in the system, which affect their probability of occurring in areas with anthropogenic disturbance. If an empirical estimate of species sensitivity exists, this can be used in setting up the system with the function `build_empirical_env`, using the argument `species_sensitivities=a`, where `a` is an array of length equal to the number of species and with values ranging from 0 (lowest sensitivity) to 1 (highest sensitivity).
